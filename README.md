# Getting Started with Create React App - TypeScript template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why TypeScript + React

With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime. \
Provide a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.\
Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.
